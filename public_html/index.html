                <h1>Aboot meh</h1> <br>
                Im 15 years old I go to Pasadena High School and am in the yung app academy. I grew up in Pasadena my whole life and love it here. 
                My favorite color is black because its 2 spooky 5 me. My favorite fruit is watermelone because its amazing. My favorite tv series is the 
                one and only Breaking Bad. Im a pretty normal kid I guess maybe a little too influenced by the Internet but meh to each to their own. Hmm
                this is my second year in the app academy and im getting pretty used to coding its kinda fun now just trying to crank as much as I can. I dont really have a constant 
                work flow though some days I really turn it on and some days I dont. I wish it was on all the time but w/e gets the job done.

                <h1>Hobbies</h1><br>
                Hmm my hobbies include playing video games, hanging out with friends, and watching e-sports scenes. I play alot of League of Legends (a really big moba).
                I enjoy playing with friends League since we party up and mess around. I also play some CSGO even though im trash. I enjoy hanging out with friends since its alot of fun just chilling
                saying dumb random things. I listen to alot of music too but my favorite right now probably has to be the Black Keys. Also as I said before I watch some e-sports scenes like League of Legends and CSGO when big tourneys
                get streamed on twitch. As of 9/25/14 the World Championships for League Of Legends is being played still. My favorite teams are TSM in League and C9 in CSGO.
